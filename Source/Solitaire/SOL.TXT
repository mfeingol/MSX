Description:

Solitaire is an implementation of a chinese solitaire game in which the obiective is to clear a clear a playing board of stones by having one jump over another until only one stone remains in the center. The game is somewhat challenging and made for decent entertainment in the '90s. Graphics for the game were borrowed from the MSX2 version of Columns. Thanks, Sega (and sorry).
