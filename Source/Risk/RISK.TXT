Description:

Risk is an implementation of the well-known multi-player board game Risk. It includes allied nations and attempts to remain faithful to the basic rules of Risk. The game is controlled using a nice windowed menu system that provides save/load functionality. Players can choose their names and define their colors using an innovative (for its time) color picker.

CTRL must be pressed at boot to free up enough memory for the game to work.

This MSX2 version does not provide an AI player. The speed of the game menus is a bit off on an (emulated) Turbo-R in R800 mode.
