Description:

Simon is an implementation of the classic Simon says memory game, using four lights. The game consists of five phases, each of which requires a sequence of twenty colors to be correctly played back. Each phase is faster than the previous one.

The game has a cute ending, which can be accessed using a cheat if memory alone does not suffice.

The speed of the game menus is a bit off on an (emulated) Turbo-R in R800 mode.
