Description:

Computer Images is a classic tile re-arrangement puzzle game that uses images from popular MSX2 games (sorry - it seemed like a good idea at the time). The game provides save/load options as well as a high-score file that records the names of players who completed specific images. MSX KUN BASIC is used to accelerate the tile movement, which is nice and smooth.

There is a cheat to see the end of the game, which is pretty cute.
